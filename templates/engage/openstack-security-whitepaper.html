        Telco, finance, insurance, healthcare, governments are among the regulated sectors, where security and in particular data privacy are fundamental to the design of your private cloud.  Encryption at rest is one of the key tenets of this design to prevent any hardware theft to expose the data. However encryption at rest without an adequate certificate lifecycle management is just creating a false sense of security.
