      <h3>About the whitepaper</h3>
      <p>With developers increasingly moving towards microservices – and with the
        growing prevalence of the cloud as the default platform – software has become
        more complex than ever.</p>
      <p>In the past, a stand-alone application was typically enough to solve a particular
        problem or provide a service to end users. But today’s solutions increasingly
        demand large bundles of interconnected microservices distributed across many
        machines, and potentially operating systems, to fulfil a single function.
      </p>
